Dear colleagues
By Mónica Orjuela,  journalist and communications officer at MHHRI 

What was once a symbol of protection, the blue press vest has now turned into a target in war zones, a clear signal that journalists are under threat rather than shielded.

Journalists are our eyes in a world challenged by war and conflict. They report from the genocides in Gaza and Sudan, from climate driven natural disasters, and from places ruled by criminal groups and authoritarian regimes. They give voice to victims, and bear witness to both the worst and the best of humanity. These are challenging times, journalist must be protected from attack, and guaranteed access to psychological care and health support.

This year, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) documented the highest number of media workers killed since it began collecting such data three decades ago. Reporters Without Borders reports that 220 Gazan journalists have been killed by Israeli forces during nearly 23 months of genocide. Those who survived the bombings are caught between staying alive and fulfilling their duty to report. Many have buried their own families and become the very subjects of the tragedies they cover.

In other countries like Pakistan, Sudan, Mexico, Syria, and Myanmar, journalists have been killed simply for doing their jobs. Additionally, the number of journalists imprisoned increased in 2024, with the highest figures reported in China, Israel, Russia, Belarus, and Myanmar. Kidnappings remain a grave threat as well, and last year nearly 100 were reported missing across 34 countries.
