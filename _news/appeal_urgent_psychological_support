**Dear friends and colleagues**,

Since Thursday last week, the authorities have shut down the internet, phone lines, and SMS. All communication in and out of the country has been cut off. The regime has declared that any demonstrator will be treated as a terrorist, and the death penalty is being used as a weapon.
