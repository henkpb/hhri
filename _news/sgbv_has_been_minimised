**Rape and other forms of sexual violence** are prohibited in both international and non-international armed conflicts. A very high number of all women in war and conflict experience one or more kinds of sexual gender-based violence.

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2002 included wartime sexual violence in its list of crimes against humanity and war crimes and defined sexual violence as “rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity”.
Historically, conflict-related sexual violence was ignored or minimised due to the following reasons:

• It was seen as “collateral damage” it happens in all wars.
• It was not considered politically relevant.
• Conflict-related sexual violence was under-reported.
• In most cases, abusers were not convicted.
• It was not part of the human rights agenda.
• There was no documentation or systematic research.

Here are some examples of how sexual violence has been used in various armed conflicts.
