subtitle: "Asylum-seekers, though not a homogeneous group, are vulnerable due to displacement, persecution, and exposure to violence. Their mental health risks increase due to extreme conditions, forced migration, personal loss, and unfamiliar environments. Stricter asylum policies can further worsen their mental well-being during the screening process."
