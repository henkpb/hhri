**Dear friends and colleagues,**

Since Thursday last week, the authorities have shut down the internet, phone lines, and SMS. All communication in and out of the country has been cut off. The regime has declared that any demonstrator will be treated as a terrorist, and the death penalty is being used as a weapon.

State TV is now broadcasting shocking images to spread fear among the population. And still we do not know much about the number of dead and injured, but there are sources that reckon that more than 2 000 people have been killed. What we do know is that body bags are accumulating and families are desperately searching for their loved ones.

This is hitting the Iranian community in exile very hard. Many have lost all contact with their closest family and live in unbearable uncertainty. There is strong concern for political prisoners and family members who risk their lives. Exposure to violent images and fear of reprisals are factors creating deep trauma in people.

The Iranian people in Iran need support – as well as the Iranian people living in exile. They are  now asking for help from health professionals and others, acting in solidarity with the people of Iran. They are encouraging the news media to invite experts who can speak about trauma, violence, and secondary traumatization in news broadcasts. This is necessary to provide guidance to those who are living outside of Iran and who are experiencing deep despair and very painful uncertainty. And to the professionals they say: We need guidance from experts with experience working with victims of torture and violence.  How should we cope with this extreme stress and fear? They ask for our support during this difficult time. The Iranian community in exile needs to be seen, heard, and cared for.

Woman, Life,  Freedom

Sincerely,
Nora Sveaass
Chairwoman of the Board MHHRI and Clinical Psychologist and Professor Emeritus
