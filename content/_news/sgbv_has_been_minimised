Rape and other forms of sexual violence** are prohibited in both international and non-international armed conflicts. A very high number of all women in war and conflict experience one or more kinds of sexual gender-based violence.

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 2002 included wartime sexual violence in its list of crimes against humanity and war crimes and defined sexual violence as “rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity”.
Historically, conflict-related sexual violence was ignored or minimised due to the following reasons:

• It was seen as “collateral damage” it happens in all wars.
• It was not considered politically relevant.
• Conflict-related sexual violence was under-reported.
• In most cases, abusers were not convicted.
• It was not part of the human rights agenda.
• There was no documentation or systematic research.

Here are some examples of how sexual violence has been used in various armed conflicts.


MHHRI have developed manuals and learning material to helpers working with survivors of sexual and gender-based violence against women, men and children, and of other trauma following serious human rights violations. Psychosocial support to helpers and professionals is also included.

We hope that this low-threshold manual will be useful in your work and that you will benefit from the knowledge presented in it. For easy access to information about the content of the manual please watch our tutorials.

Here you can access to various lectures on topics related to gender-based violence and our manuals.

In each of the modules, you can select either the download format or the online reading format in different languages. You can also find the manual and other support elements in different languages.
