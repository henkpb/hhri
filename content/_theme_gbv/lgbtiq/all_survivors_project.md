Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) against women and girls has received increasing attention globally. At the same time, less is known about men, boys and LGBT persons who suffer CRSV. Research estimates that, in some context, the magnitude of CRSV against men and boys is extremely high, with prevalence rates ranging from 32.6% in Liberia to 21% in Sri Lanka. The health and social consequences of CRSV for the lives of men, boys and LGBT persons are severe and long-lasting. CRSV against men, boys and LGBT persons is largely motivated by gendered expression of domination and control. Despite the severe health and social burden associated with CRSV, evidence on interventions addressing the health and wellbeing of male and LGBT survivors of CRSV remains scarce, and limited resources and support are available to target their needs. This report addresses these gaps by summarising and expanding on key findings from a forthcoming realist review by the authors on health interventions for men, boys and LGBT survivors of CRSV.
