The term “gender-based violence” refers to violence that targets individuals or groups on the basis of their gender. The United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights’ [Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committ.htm) (CEDAW) defines it as “violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately”, in its [General Recommendation 19](http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recomm.htm).
