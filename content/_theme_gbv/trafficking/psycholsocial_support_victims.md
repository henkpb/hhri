The publication of the Forth volume of the Psychosocial Notebooks series is an important and pleasant event for me for different reasons. I am extremely glad about the quality of the papers and the relevance of the issues raised. Yet, this notebook also represents a multi-faceted leap forward in a wider perspective. On the one hand, it is the product of many years of interdisciplinary work, a demonstration that the methodology and work philosophy described in the first three notebooks, have been positively acknowledged by other service areas of our organization and have also played a role in enriching their work. On the other hand, this publication highlights the importance of considering the psychosocial approach not merely as a confined professional domain, but as a possible - and perhaps indispensable - component of a variety of programs and interventions for mobile populations.
