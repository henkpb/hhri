In addition to the [Caring for Child Survivor Guidelines](https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/library/caring-child-survivors-sexual-abuse-guidelines-health-and-psychosocial-service-providers), training materials have been developed to support staff in carrying out training on the content of the guidelines.  The training materials are broken down by topical modules that follow the outline of the CCS Guidelines.  Each module includes a PowerPoint presentation and a Facilitators’ Guide outlining the training content, methodology and materials required to deliver the module.  Supplementary handouts are provided in modules when relevant. The training package also includes a sample agenda, evaluation tools (e.g. pre/post tests and a workshop evaluation), and a Users’ Guide which summarizes how the training materials should be used.
