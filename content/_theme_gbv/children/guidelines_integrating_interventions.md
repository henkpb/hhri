This Thematic Area Guide (TAG) is excerpted from the comprehensive Inter-Agency Standing Committee Guidelines for Integrating Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action: Reducing risk, promoting resilience and aiding recovery (IASC, 2015). The purpose of this TAG is to assist water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) actors and communities affected by armed conflict, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies to coordinate, plan, implement, monitor and evaluate essential actions for the prevention and mitigation of gender-based violence (GBV) across the WASH sector.
