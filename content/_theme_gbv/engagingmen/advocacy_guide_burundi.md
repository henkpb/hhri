This guide was developed as a resource for communitybased activists who are working to eliminate gender-based violence in their communities. Often, activists have several roles. Sometimes activists provide case management, and sometimes they educate their communities. Some activists do both. The aims is to create an environment that promotes safe, peaceful and productive families and communities and to envision a Burundi that is free from gender-based violence.
