The 2015 edition of the Camp Management Toolkit represents the most comprehensive guidance for those engaged in camp responses to displacement. The Toolkit provides guidelines that serve as practical support for national authorities, national and international humanitarian actors, as well as internally displaced persons and refugees involved in camp management. There is a separate chapter on GBV.
