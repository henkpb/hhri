This guide describes best practices in the clinical management of people who have been raped in emergency situations. It is intended for adaptation to each situation, taking into account national policies and practices, and availability of materials and drugs. This guide is intended for use by qualified health care providers (health coordinators, medical doctors, clinical officers, midwives and nurses) in developing protocols for the management of rape survivors in emergencies, taking into account available resources, materials, and drugs, and national policies and procedures. It can also be used in planning care services and in training health care providers. The document includes detailed guidance on the clinical management of women, men and children who have been raped. It does not include advice on standard care of wounds or injuries or on psychological counselling, although these may be needed as part of comprehensive care for someone who has been raped.
