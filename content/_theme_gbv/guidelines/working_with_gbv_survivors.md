UNRWA prioritises gender equality and the empowerment of women, and over the course of its existence has achieved much success. UNRWA is now building on this work to address a difficult but important gender issue: Gender Based Violence (GBV). GBV blights the lives of too many Palestine refugees and exists as a major obstacle to many women, girls and boys achieving their full potential. In order to achieve its human development goals, UNRWA must respond to this serious problem.
