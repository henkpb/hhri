The damaging, pervasive and life-long impacts of sexual assault for survivors/victims are well documented (see, for example, Quadara, 2015). Responses to sexual violence have evolved as the nature and complexities of this type of violence has become better understood, particularly in light of the ways sexual victimisation is associated with the physical and mental health of sexual assault survivors (Quadara, 2015; Dworkin & Shumacher, 2016). Alongside research, practitioners across a diversity of sectors and services have identified the prevalence of trauma histories among service users, and particularly, the need for services that come in contact with sexual assault survivors to adopt trauma-informed care and practice (TICP) (Quadara, 2015).
