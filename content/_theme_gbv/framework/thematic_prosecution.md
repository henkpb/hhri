Deals with the topic of thematic prosecution of core international crimes. Its focus is on international sex crimes. It is important to justify the singling out of a narrow range of criminality for prosecution, whether in internationalized or national criminal jurisdictions. Thematic prosecutions should be explained to the public. Absent proper justification, the thematic prosecution of core international crimes is likely to generate increasing controversy. This timely publication will hopefully raise awareness and generate discussion about the possibilities and challenges of the use of thematic prosecution among those working in criminal justice agencies, academia, civil society, and the media (474 pages).
