Policy makers on violence against women consistently request more and better quality information, including data, on violence against women in order to: guide legislative and policy reforms; ensure adequate provision of targeted and effective services; monitor trends and progress in addressing and eliminating violence against women; and assess the impact of measures taken. Indicators, with their associated benchmarks, contribute to organizing data into a form which contributes to the evaluation of policies and monitoring of progress in achieving goals. They enable an evidence-based comparison of trends over time, and within and between countries.
