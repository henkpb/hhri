This is why for 10 years I have been calling on the international community to draw a red line against the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. The time has come for States to act to stop this scourge. To support my call to action, the Mukwege Foundation has launched the “Red Line Initiative”, a global campaign to eliminate the use of sexual violence in conflict, the first of which is the launch of the “Guidebook on State Obligations for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence”.
