The Murad Code project is a global, consultative initiative which aims to build and support a community of better practice for, with and concerning survivors of systematic and conflict-related sexual violence. For years, survivors of systematic and conflict-related sexual violence (SCRSV) have shared their frustrations and trauma about participating in ineffective and unethical interactions with people documenting, investigating, reporting, researching, monitoring or otherwise gathering or using information about SCRSV. No matter how well-intentioned they may be, when people doing this work do not follow the existing laws and relevant minimum standards, they cause or further amplify harm to survivors.
