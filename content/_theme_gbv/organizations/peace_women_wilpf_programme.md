PeaceWomen is the Women, Peace and Security Programme of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), the oldest women's peace organization in the world. We work for feminist peace by strengthening women’s meaningful participation, transforming gendered power, and bridging local gender conflict analysis with global efforts to implement a holistic WPS Agenda.
