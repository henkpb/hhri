The NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security works to advance the Women, Peace and Security agenda at the United Nations and around the world.Since 2000 we have been working to bring the voices of women's rights defenders and local peacebuilders into the New York peace and security discussions. It serves as a bridge between women's human rights defenders and peacebuilders working in conflict-affected situations and senior policy-makers at UN Headquarters.
