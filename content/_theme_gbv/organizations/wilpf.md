Founded in 1915, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) is a membership-based feminist peacebuilding organisation with presence and impact around the world. Our global movement includes member Sections and Groups in over 40 countries across the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa. Feminist, pacifist and antimilitarist in our values and approach, we promote and amplify the voices of women and allies who are advancing peaceful and sustainable alternatives to crises and conflicts. As a mobiliser, convenor and thought leader, we work hand in hand with activists, networks, coalitions, platforms and civil society organisations worldwide to advance a future of peace, justice and equality for all. WILPF has consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
