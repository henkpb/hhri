The effects of climate change, such as changes in temperatures, precipitation and biodiversity loss, are affecting human health, food security and livelihoods, as well as the quality and availability of land, water and other natural resources. As individuals are intrinsically linked to their environment, climate change poses a serious threat to every aspect of human life. It has been long recognized that the consequences of climate change are not experienced evenly, and women – who are less likely than men to own productive assets and are more dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods – are likely to be disproportionately affected. Social norms often put women in charge of gathering food, collecting water and fetching fuel for cooking and heating – chores that are increasingly time-consuming as climate change affects the availability and quality of these resources.
