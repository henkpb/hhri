UNODC and UN Women have joined forces to improve data collection through the Statistical framework for measuring the gender-related killing of women and girls (also referred to as “femicide/feminicide”). We have seen some signs of improvement: 99 countries had at least one data point on female intimate partner/ family-related homicide in the period 2016-2022, up from 74 countries in 2009-2015. But more support is required, especially for developing countries which lack the funding and capacities to improve femicide reporting and responses, in line with commitments to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
