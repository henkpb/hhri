Intimate partner femicide is often the end result of long-term abuse and coercive control. While previous research has explored these dynamics, less is known about how perpetrators avoid intervention before the killing. This study analyzes the life histories of 97 men imprisoned for femicide across nine Latin American countries. It identifies seven common strategies used to avoid detection: social isolation, gaslighting, restricting employment, framing others as threats, male peer support, controlling the woman’s body and space, and disrupting access to healthcare. These tactics helped perpetrators remain unnoticed by others, revealing missed chances for intervention. The findings underscore the role of male complicity and point to the need for earlier recognition of coercive patterns to prevent lethal outcomes.
