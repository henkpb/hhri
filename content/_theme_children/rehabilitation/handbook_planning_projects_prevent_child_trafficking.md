Although a lot has been learnt already about practical ways in which adults and children who have been trafficked can be protected and assisted, much less attention has been given in recent years to drawing lessons about what techniques succeed in preventing trafficking from occurring. As a result, donors seem reluctant to invest money in efforts to prevent child trafficking, even though they are familiar with the old adage, prevention is better than cure. Giving prevention more attention means improving the quality of preventive work, as well as increasing the amount of work being done. This handbook is a contribution towards that improvement, distilling some of the lessons which have already been learnt by many different organisations.
