Children who experience violence are at increased risk of developing psychosocial and mental health problems; however, most children in these settings do not receive the care they need. The HealthNet TPO program delivers a multi-tiered psychosocial care package combining mental health promotion, prevention and treatment to address the needs of at-risk children and adolescents.
