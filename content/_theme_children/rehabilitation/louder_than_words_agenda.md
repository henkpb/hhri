Child Soldiers International (previously known as the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers) was established in 1998 to campaign for the adoption of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (Optional Protocol) and now works for its universal ratification and effective implementation. We are publishing this report to mark the tenth anniversary of the year in which the Optional Protocol entered into force as part of our ongoing efforts to support this important treaty’s core aim to protect girls and boys under the age of 18 years from participation in armed conflict.
