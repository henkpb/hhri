The number of countries in Africa where there is internal armed conflict has grown steadily over the past decade. Children are the most vulnerable population affected; they are the first victims of physical, social, and emotional violence, and of failed health systems. When access to education is severed, their potential to develop is stunted. This document is a response to the growing need to address these issues from the Office of Sustainable Development of USAIDs Africa Bureau (AFR/SD).
