This video is an adaptation [of the children’s book, My Hero is You, released in early 2020 to help educate children around the world about COVID-19](https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/inter-agency-standing-committee/adapted-iasc-childrens-book-animated-film-my-hero-you-now-available). The original book was created by mental health and psychosocial support experts from the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the highest-level humanitarian coordination forum of the United Nations. A team, led by Stanford Medicine’s Maya Adam, adapted the story into a short animated film, with input and oversight from the IASC Mental health and Psychosocial Support Reference Group, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The film aims to convey messages of hope, resilience, solidarity, and empowerment to children and their caregivers around the world. https://youtu.be/FdO7MHlCkys
