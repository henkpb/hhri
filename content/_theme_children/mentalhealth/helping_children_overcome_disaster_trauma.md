The primary aim of this report is to review possible theoretical underpinnings and practical methods utilized by psychosocial sports programs in helping children traumatized in disaster. The method of assessment will be to examine existing research and documentation on the subject of psychosocial sports interventions with youth traumatized by disasters, and to draw upon the learning examples from currently active psychosocial sports programs in the field.
