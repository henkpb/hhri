The sheer scale of child displacement, combined with a humanitarian system that is failing to meet their needs, means that the basic rights of millions of children are being denied. This is despite the fact that these rights are innate, and should stay with them even when they flee. They may have moved, their rights haven’t. It is a scandal that any child, let alone many millions, should be forced into this position, especially when international laws and conventions (such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1951 Refugee Convention) were created to prevent the denial of their rights and secure the protection of every child, no matter where the lottery of life meant they were born. There is a core set of rights that no child fleeing conflict should be denied. For the thousands of children who flee conflict every day, they have already lost so much. It is unacceptable that they should also lose their rights. The unfolding crisis for children forced to flee demands an urgent, coordinated and global response
