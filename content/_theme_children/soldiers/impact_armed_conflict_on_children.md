Twenty years ago, Graça Machel’s report “[Impact of armed conflict on children](https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/about-us/mandate/the-machel-reports/)”, asked the international community to come together to address the plight of children affected by war. For two years, Machel had travelled to conflict zones and met children, families, humanitarian workers and Government officials to better understand what boys and girls were going through.
