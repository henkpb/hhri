Dear colleague, welcome to our website on sexual violence against children in war, conflict, humanitarian crisis and low-resource communities.

If you are working with or assisting children exposed to sexual violence or involved in the training of helpers or caregivers working directly with child survivors, this is a good resource for you. We hope that this manual will be useful in your work and that you will benefit from the knowledge presented in it.
The manual can be found in several languages: [English](https://www.hhri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/817-HHRI_children_ENG_web.pdf), [Norwegian](https://www.hhri.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Barn-utsatt-for-seksuell-vold_web.pdf), [Nepali](https://www.hhri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/HHRI_children_Nepali_Sept.pdf) and [Ukrainian](https://www.hhri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/HHRI_children_UKR_web.pdf).

In each of the boxes, you can choose either the download or online reading format.
